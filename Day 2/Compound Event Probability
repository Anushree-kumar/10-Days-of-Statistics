## Problem Statement
There are three urns labeled X, Y, and Z.
- Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
- Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
- Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, out of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?

## Solution Approach
To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of drawing 2 red balls and 1 black ball from the three urns.

## Total Possible Outcomes
The total number of possible outcomes can be calculated by multiplying the number of balls in each urn:
- Urn X: 7 balls
- Urn Y: 9 balls
- Urn Z: 8 balls

So, the total number of possible outcomes is 7*9*8=504.

## Favorable Outcomes
We need to find the combinations of outcomes where exactly 2 red balls and 1 black ball are drawn. This can happen in the following ways:
1. Red from X, Red from Y, Black from Z
2. Red from X, Black from Y, Red from Z
3. Black from X, Red from Y, Red from Z

We calculate the number of favorable outcomes for each case:
1. 4 * 5 * 4 = 80 (Red from X, Red from Y, Black from Z)
2. 4 * 4 * 4 = 64 (Red from X, Black from Y, Red from Z)
3. 3 * 5 * 4 = 60 (Black from X, Red from Y, Red from Z)

So, the total number of favorable outcomes is 80 + 64 + 60 = 204.

## Probability Calculation
The probability of drawing 2 red balls and 1 black ball is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:
Number of Favorable Outcomes/Total Number of Outcomes=204/504 = 17/42

## Answer
The probability that, out of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black, is 17/42.
