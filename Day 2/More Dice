## Problem Statement
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6.
1. 1 / 9
2. 1 / 6
3. 2 / 3
4. 5 / 6

## Solution Approach
To solve this problem, we need to find the combinations of outcomes where:
1. The values rolled by each die are different.
2. The sum of the values on the two dice is 6.

## Total Possible Outcomes
Each die has six sides, so the total number of outcomes when tossing two dice is 6*6=36.

## Favorable Outcomes
We need to find the combinations of outcomes where the values on the two dice are different and the sum is 6. These combinations are:
- (1, 5)
- (2, 4)
- (4, 2)
- (5, 1)

There are 4 favorable outcomes.

## Probability Calculation
The probability of getting a sum of 6 with different values on each die is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:
Number of Favorable Outcomes/Total Number of Outcomes= 4/36 = 1/9

## Answer
The probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6 is 1/9.
