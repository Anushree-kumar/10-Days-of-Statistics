## Problem Statement
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most 9.
1.<p>2 / 3</p>
2.<p>5 / 6</p>
3.<p>1 / 4</p>
4.<p>1 / 6</p>

## Solution Approach
To solve this problem, we first need to understand the total number of possible outcomes and then count the favorable outcomes where the sum is at most 9.

## Total Possible Outcomes
Each die has six sides, so the total number of outcomes when tossing two dice is 6*6=36.

## Favorable Outcomes
We need to find the combinations of outcomes where the sum of the numbers on the dice is at most 9. We can list these combinations as follows:
- (1, 1)
- (1, 2), (2, 1)
- (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)
- (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1)
- (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1)
- (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1)
- (2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 2)
- (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3)
- (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 4)
- (5, 6), (6, 5)
- (6, 6)

There are 30 favorable outcomes.

## Probability Calculation
The probability of getting a sum of at most 9 is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:
Number of Favorable Outcomes/Total Number of Outcomes= 30/36 = 5/6

## Answer
The probability that the sum will be at most 9 is 5/6.
