## Problem Statement
Suppose a family has 2 children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?

## Solution Approach
To solve this problem, we need to use conditional probability, specifically the concept of Bayes' theorem.

## Possible Scenarios
Let's denote the children as A and B. There are four possible scenarios for the gender of the two children:
1. A is a boy, B is a boy (BB)
2. A is a boy, B is a girl (BG)
3. A is a girl, B is a boy (GB)
4. A is a girl, B is a girl (GG)

Given that one child is a boy, we can eliminate scenario 4 (GG). This leaves us with three possible scenarios: BB, BG, and GB.

## Favorable Outcome
We are interested in the probability that both children are boys, which corresponds to scenario 1 (BB).

## Probability Calculation
The probability of scenario 1 (BB) occurring among the remaining scenarios (BB, BG, GB) can be calculated as follows:
Probability of BB= Number of favorable outcomes (BB)/Total remaining outcomes (BB, BG, GB)

## Answer
By considering the remaining possible scenarios after knowing one child is a boy, the probability that both children are boys is 1/3.
