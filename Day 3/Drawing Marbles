Problem Statement:
A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

Solution Approach:
To solve this problem, we need to use conditional probability, specifically the concept of Bayes' theorem.

Possible Scenarios:
Given that the first marble drawn is red, there are two possible scenarios for the second marble:
The second marble drawn is blue.
The second marble drawn is red.

Favorable Outcome:
We are interested in the probability that the second marble drawn is blue.

Probability Calculation:
The probability of the second marble being blue can be calculated using conditional probability:

Probability of second marble being blue = Number of favorable outcomes (blue second) /Total number of outcomes given red first

Answer:
By considering the given condition and using conditional probability, the probability that the second marble drawn is blue is 
4/6 = 2/3.
